2. In the search box, type in your question or click on one of the suggested questions below 
    1. Note: The suggested question that appear below search bar are questions that were previously “approved” as apart of the data source onboarding fine tuning step. These questions are selected randomly.
    2. As a user is typing, suggested questions drop down below the input. These questions are also selected from the “approved” questions from the data source onboarding fine tuning step.
3. Depending on the complexity of the question, data should be returned between 5 - 15 seconds.
